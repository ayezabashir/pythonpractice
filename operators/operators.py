# operators are used to perform operations on values
# python divides the operators in 7 divisions

# 1- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
print(7 + 7)
print(7 - 7)
print(7 / 7)
print(7 // 7)  # floor division
print(7 % 7)
print(7 * 7)
print(7 ** 7)  # exponentiation

# 2- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
a = 5
print(a)
a +=5
print(a)
a -=5
print(a)
a = 15
a *=5
print(a)
a = 15
a /=5
print(a)
a = 15
a %=5
print(a)
a = 15
a //=5
print(a)
a = 2
a **=5
print(a)
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3

# COMPARISON OPERTAORS
print(7==7)
print(7!=8)
print(8>7)
print(7<8)
print(7>=7)
print(7<=7)

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
print(5==5 and 7>5)
print(5==5 or 5>5)
print(not(5<7))

# IDENTITY OPERATOR
print(5 is 5)
print(6 is not 5)

# MEMBERSHIP OPERATOR
x = range(0,9)
print(4 in x)
fruits = ['apple', 'banana']
print('orange' not in x)

# BITWISE OPERATOR
